# Spring-MVC-Skeleton 
This is a basic skeleton of an MVC project built with the Spring Java Framework :computer:, the classes and files contained are a mini sample that aims to show the data flow through the layers of the template.

**First**, you can take a look to the dependencies of this template in the `pom.xml` file.

This project contains the configuration for mapping action requests to the Servlets in the `controllers` package :package:. As an example, this package contains the `PublicController.java` servlet with one method mapped to a GET request and other mapped to a POST request.

The views :eyes: are contained in the `web/WEB-INF/views/` directory and must be **JSP** files, I recommend you to use the **JSTL** for scripting :ok_hand:.

The resources are mapped to the `web/resources/` directory, where we can place our **CSS**, **JavaScript** files, **Fonts** and so on :thumbsup:.

For more information about this example and how it can be applyed with a Model layer, you can visit this blog post:
